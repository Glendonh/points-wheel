# Custom Prize Wheel

## Purpose

This application was built for a friend teaching ESL classes. He divides his classes into groups, and asks them questions. When a group answers correctly, he spins the wheel and the points that come up are added to the team's score.

He had been using a similar application but requested some additional features:

- The ability to set the number of teams at the start of the game.
- The ability to edit scores if points are accidentally assigned to the wrong team.
